Project Name : Customer Segmentation and Advertisement

Description : Customer Segmentation is the division of potential customers in a given market into discrete groups. 
That division is based on customers' Needs and Buying Characteristics. Customer Segmentation is a critical component of a company's go-to-market strategy.
 Identifying and prioritizing high value customer segments (and just as importantly, deprioritizing low value segments) 
enables us to maximize our impact by aligning marketing, sales and product resources.

Main techniques used : RFM Modelling , Elbow criterion , K-Means Clustering.

Softwares used : Anaconda Prompt , Jupyter Notebook , MS Excel.

Language used : Python 3.6

Aim of this project : The main goal is to identify the types of customers a particular market has. Using this methodology, 
Marketers would get to know who are their Loyal Customers, who are moderate and who are on the verge of churning out, 
so that different types of offers and discounts and other strategies can be applied accordingly to bring them back again and again.
